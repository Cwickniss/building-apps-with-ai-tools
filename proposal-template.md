<course_description>
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI applications connect to data sources and tools. Think of it like a "USB-C port for AI" - a universal connector that lets Large Language Models (LLMs) seamlessly integrate with external systems.

In this hands-on course, you'll learn how to build MCP servers that expose tools, resources, and prompts to LLMs like Claude. You'll explore how to create AI workflows that leverage external context and tools through MCP, enabling more powerful and context-aware AI assistants.

Through practical examples, you'll build a weather API server, create multi-step agent workflows, and learn how to implement authentication and security for your MCP integrations. By the end of this course, you'll have the skills to build sophisticated AI-augmented workflows that connect LLMs to the data and tools they need to be truly useful.
