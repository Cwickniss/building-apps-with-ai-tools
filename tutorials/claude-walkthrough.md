## Getting Started with Claude

### 1. Basic Chat Interface

Claude's chat interface is your primary tool for:
- Code generation and review
- Problem-solving discussions
- Architecture planning
- Debugging assistance

### 2. Context Management

With 200k tokens of context, Claude can:
- Process entire codebases
- Maintain conversation history
- Reference multiple files simultaneously
- Provide consistent responses across long sessions

### 3. File Integration

Upload various file types to:
- Analyze existing code
- Review documentation
- Process images and diagrams
- Import data from external sources

### 4. Claude Artifacts

Interactive development environment for:
- Live code preview
- Real-time modifications
- Interactive prototyping
- Immediate feedback

### 5. Claude Projects

Advanced project management featuring:
- Multi-file organization
- Complex requirement handling
- Team collaboration
- Version control integration

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### Role-Based Prompting
```
Act as a senior web developer with expertise in JavaScript and APIs.
Help me build a weather application with the following requirements...
```

### Context-Specific Prompting
```
Given this existing codebase structure:
[paste code structure]

Add a new feature that allows users to...
```

### Clear and Direct Instructions
```
Create a JavaScript function that:
1. Fetches data from an API
2. Handles errors gracefully
3. Returns parsed JSON
4. Includes TypeScript types
```

### Meta Prompting
```
Review this prompt and suggest improvements:
"Make a website that looks good and works well"

Provide a more specific and actionable version.
```

## Best Practices for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Start with Clear Specifications**
   - Define requirements precisely
   - Provide context and constraints
   - Include examples when possible

2. **Iterative Development**
   - Build incrementally
   - Test frequently
   - Refine based on results

3. **Code Review and Validation**
   - Always review generated code
   - Test thoroughly
   - Understand before implementing

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Never expose sensitive data
   - Validate all inputs
   - Follow security best practices

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Planning Phase
- Use Claude for requirement analysis
- Generate project specifications
- Create architecture diagrams

### Development Phase
- Generate boilerplate code
- Implement specific features
- Debug and optimize

### Testing Phase
- Create test cases
- Review code quality
- Validate functionality

### Documentation Phase
- Generate documentation
- Create user guides
- Write API references
