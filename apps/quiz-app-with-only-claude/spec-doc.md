# Modern Quiz App Specification Document

## Project Overview
The Modern Quiz App is a web-based application designed to provide an interactive quiz experience. It allows users to upload quiz data in JSON format, take quizzes with multiple-choice or open-ended questions, receive immediate feedback, and export results in different formats.

The application features a clean, modern UI with responsive design elements and provides functionality for quiz-taking, scoring, and result exporting.

## Core Functionalities

### 1. Quiz Loading
- Users can upload quiz data in JSON format
- Supports two question types:
- Validates JSON structure before enabling quiz start
  - Multiple-choice questions with selectable options
  - Open-ended questions with text input

### 2. Quiz Interface
- Displays one question at a time with question number and text
- For multiple-choice questions:
  - Shows options in a 2-column grid
  - Allows selection with visual feedback
- For open-ended questions:
  - Provides a textarea for user input
  - Validates non-empty submissions

### 3. Quiz Flow
- Sequential navigation through questions
- Answer submission validation before proceeding
- Automatic progression to next question after submission
- Quiz completion detection and results display

### 4. Scoring System
- Tracks correct answers and calculates final score
- For multiple-choice: Exact match with predefined correct answer index
- For open-ended: Case-insensitive match with any accepted answer

### 5. Results Display
- Shows final score as fraction of total questions
- Provides detailed feedback for each question
- Color-coded feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect)
- Displays user answer and correct answer for each question

### 6. Data Export
- CSV export with question, user answer, correct answer, and result
- Anki flashcard export (question and correct answer pairs)
- Client-side file generation with automatic download

## Technical Specifications

### Data Structure
The app expects quiz data in the following JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "type": "multiple-choice",
    "question": "Question text here",
    "options": ["Option 1", "Option 2", "Option 3", "Option 4"],
    "correctAnswer": 2  // Zero-based index of correct option
  },
  {
    "type": "open-ended",
    "question": "Open-ended question text here",
    "acceptedAnswers": ["Answer 1", "Alternative Answer"]  // Array of accepted answers
  }
]
```

### User Interface Components
- File upload button with custom styling
- Start quiz button (disabled until valid file upload)
- Question container with dynamic content based on question type
- Submit button for answer confirmation
- Results container with score and detailed feedback
- Export buttons for different data formats

### Visual Design
- Clean, modern interface with rounded corners and subtle shadows
- Color scheme:
  - Primary: Blue (#3498db) for interactive elements
  - Success: Green (#2ecc71) for action buttons and correct answers
  - Error: Red tones for incorrect answers
  - Neutral: Light grays for backgrounds and containers
- Responsive layout with appropriate spacing and typography
- Interactive elements with hover states and transitions

## Current File Structure
The application is contained in a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript:

```
index.html
├── <head>
│   ├── Meta tags
│   ├── Title
│   └── CSS styles
└── <body>
    ├── UI container
    │   ├── File upload section
    │   ├── Question container
    │   └── Results container
    └── JavaScript
        ├── Variable declarations
        ├── Event listeners
        ├── File handling functions
        ├── Quiz management functions
        └── Results and export functions
```

## Implementation Notes

### Current Limitations
1. No persistent storage of quiz results (session-only)
2. Limited validation of uploaded JSON structure
3. No support for images or multimedia in questions
4. No timed quiz functionality
5. No user account system or quiz history

### Improvement Opportunities
1. **Enhanced Quiz Format**:
   - Support for images in questions and answers
   - Add support for additional question types (true/false, matching, etc.)
   - Include question categories or topics

2. **User Experience**:
   - Add a progress indicator for quiz completion
   - Implement quiz timing options
   - Add a confirmation dialog before quiz submission
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for navigation

3. **Data Management**:
   - Add local storage for saving quiz progress
   - Implement a server-side component for quiz management
   - Add quiz creation/editing functionality
   - Include quiz sharing capabilities

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Improve keyboard navigation
   - Add screen reader support
   - Enhance color contrast for better visibility
   - Add ARIA attributes for better assistive technology integration

5. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Refactor to use a modern framework (React, Vue, etc.)
   - Implement module bundling for better code organization
   - Add automated testing
   - Improve error handling and user feedback

## Browser Compatibility
The application uses modern JavaScript features and DOM APIs that are supported in:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 10.1+
- Edge 79+

Mobile browsers are supported through responsive design, but touch interactions could be optimized further.
