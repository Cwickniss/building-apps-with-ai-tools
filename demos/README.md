# Demo Structure for Building Apps with AI Tools

This directory contains all demos organized to align with the presentation flow. Each demo builds upon the previous concepts.

## Demo Sequence

### 1. Claude Walkthrough (`1-claude-walkthrough/`)
- Basic Claude interaction examples
- Multi-modal capabilities demo
- Claude Projects setup
- Claude Artifacts examples
- Prompting best practices

### 2. Cursor Walkthrough (`2-cursor-walkthrough/`)
- Setting up Cursor IDE
- Understanding .cursorrules (legacy and modern)
- Using @ references for context
- Spec document examples
- Agentic mode demonstration

### 3. Building a Simple Webpage (`3-simple-webpage/`)
- Starting from a problem statement
- Creating a spec document
- Building with Cursor assistance
- Adding interactivity
- Local storage implementation

### 4. Building a Quiz App (`4-quiz-app/`)
- Complete spec document
- Step-by-step implementation
- Adding features incrementally
- Testing and refinement
- Best practices in action

### 5. API Integration (`5-api-integration/`)
- Weather API example
- Secure API key handling
- Frontend/backend separation
- Error handling patterns
- User-friendly interfaces

## How to Use These Demos

1. **Follow the presentation order** - Each demo builds on concepts from the previous one
2. **Start fresh for each demo** - Show the complete workflow from problem to solution
3. **Emphasize the iterative process** - Show how AI helps refine and improve
4. **Encourage experimentation** - Let students try variations

## Quick Demo Tips

- Always start by showing the problem/need
- Use the appropriate tool for each stage (Claude for planning, Cursor for building)
- Show both successes and how to handle errors
- Keep demos under 10-15 minutes each
- Have backup versions ready in case of issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

- **API Keys**: Never expose them in demos. Use environment variables or proxy servers
- **Live Coding Errors**: Embrace them as learning opportunities
- **Time Management**: Have checkpoints where you can skip ahead if needed
- **Network Issues**: Have offline versions of demos ready
