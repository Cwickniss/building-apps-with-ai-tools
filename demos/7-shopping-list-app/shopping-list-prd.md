# Shopping List Application Specification

## Problem Statement
Create a comprehensive shopping list application that allows users to manage their shopping items with categories, track purchases, and maintain an organized list with import/export capabilities for data portability.

## Core Features

### 1. Item Management
- Add items with name, quantity, and category
- Edit existing item names inline
- Delete individual items
- Mark items as purchased/unpurchased with checkbox
- Visual distinction for purchased items (strikethrough text, reduced opacity)

### 2. Category Organization
- Pre-defined categories: Produce, Dairy, Meat & Fish, Bakery, Pantry, Frozen, Beverages, Household, Personal Care, Other
- Dynamic tab navigation showing only categories with items
- "All Items" view as default tab
- Category-specific views with item counts and purchase statistics

### 3. Data Persistence
- Automatic saving to browser localStorage
- Persist all item properties including purchase status
- Load saved data on page refresh

### 4. Summary Dashboard
- Display category-wise breakdown with item counts and quantities
- Show total items count with purchased status
- Real-time updates as items are added/modified/deleted

### 5. Bulk Operations
- Clear all purchased items with confirmation
- Clear entire list with confirmation
- Export shopping list as formatted JSON file with date stamp
- Import previously exported JSON files

## Technical Requirements

### Development Constraints
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- No external dependencies or frameworks
- Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation
- Mobile-responsive design
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Data Structure
```json
{
  "items": [
    {

      "category": "Dairy",
      "purchased": false,
      "dateAdded": "2024-12-28T12:00:00.000Z"
    }

- Clear inputs after successful addition
- Support Enter key submission from name field

#### Editing Items
- Use browser prompt for name editing
- Validate new name is not empty
- Preserve all other item properties
- Trigger re-render after update

#### Deleting Items

- No confirmation required (immediate deletion)

#### Toggle Purchase Status
- Flip boolean value on checkbox change
- Update visual state (opacity, strikethrough)
- Persist change to localStorage

#### Category Navigation

### Performance Considerations
- Debounce rendering operations
- Use single render function for consistency
- Minimize DOM manipulations
- Efficient array operations for filtering

### Accessibility Features
- Semantic HTML structure
- Proper label associations
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus states on interactive elements
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Browser Support

## Implementation Notes

### Key Functions Required
1. `loadData()` - Initialize from localStorage or defaults
2. `saveData()` - Persist to localStorage
3. `addItem()` - Create new shopping item
4. `editItem(id)` - Modify item name
5. `deleteItem(id)` - Remove item
6. `toggleItem(id)` - Change purchase status
7. `renderTabs()` - Generate category navigation
8. `renderItems()` - Display all items
9. `showCategory(name)` - Filter by category
10. `updateSummary()` - Calculate statistics
11. `clearPurchased()` - Remove completed items
12. `clearAll()` - Empty entire list
13. `exportData()` - Download JSON file
14. `importData(event)` - Load JSON file

### State Management
- Single global object `shoppingData` with items array and categories map
- localStorage key: 'shoppingList'
- Synchronous updates with immediate persistence
- Full re-render on state changes

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for JSON operations
- User alerts for validation failures
- File format validation on import
- Graceful degradation if localStorage unavailable

### Mobile Optimizations
- Viewport meta tag for proper scaling
- Flexible layouts with wrap behavior
- Touch-friendly button sizes (minimum 44px tap targets)
- Responsive typography scaling
- Column layout for inputs on narrow screens

## Deliverable
A single, self-contained HTML file with all CSS and JavaScript embedded inline that provides a fully functional shopping list application meeting all specifications above. The file should be production-ready with no console errors and smooth performance across devices.
