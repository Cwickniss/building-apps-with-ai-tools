# Claude Walkthrough Demo

## Key Points to Cover

### 1. Multi-Modal Chat
- Show image analysis capabilities
- Demonstrate code generation from descriptions
- Use Claude for diagram creation (Mermaid)

### 2. Claude Projects
- Create a project for the quiz app
- Add context files
- Show how context improves responses

### 3. Claude Artifacts
- Generate a simple interactive component
- Show real-time preview
- Iterate on the design

### 4. Prompting Best Practices
- Role-based prompting example
- Context-aware prompts
- Meta-prompting demonstration

## Example Prompts

### Basic Code Generation
```
Create a simple todo list application using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The app should:
- Allow users to add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Save tasks to local storage
- Work on mobile devices
```

### Diagram Generation
```
Create a Mermaid diagram showing the flow of a quiz application from start to finish, including user interactions and data flow.
```

### Meta Prompt
```
Help me improve this prompt: "make a weather app"

I want the AI to understand that I need a simple, educational example that demonstrates API usage without exposing keys.
```

## Live Demo Flow

1. Start with simple chat interaction
2. Progress to code generation
3. Show artifact creation
4. Demonstrate project setup
5. End with meta-prompting
